**FINAL ANALYSIS:**

**Question:**  How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?

**Answer:** # There is an large gulf between the cost of renting and the cost of buying/owning in San Francisco, though this divide is more dramatic in Southern San Francisco (evidenced by the smaller, darker blue dots.)


**Question:** What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?

**Answer:** # In light of the this gulf, the buy-and-rent strategy could be very attractive to real estate investors.  If current trends were to continue, this buy-and-rent strategy could be very lucrative in Southern San Francisco as evidenced by the smaller, darker blue dots.  These dots represent a neighborhood with lower price/square foot but high gross rents.  Leveraging this gap would be the key to investment success.
